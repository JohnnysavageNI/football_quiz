# Football Quiz

This quiz is for football fans to test their knowledge. The aim is to get as high of a score as possible from the array of questions provided, when the quiz is complete an alert will appear to display the result and when you click 'OK' the page refreshes to reset.

This quiz hopes to give users an engaging and enjoyable experience through testing their knowledge and offering an easy to use knowledge checker with an intuitive design.

- All CSS was tested in [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) one error. A grid-template-column was removed.
